# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Task

My task was to built a work day planner where the user can manage their daily tasks. The user is presented with the day, month, and year of when the user access the planner and a 9 to 5 hourly planner. The user can create and save their tasks, as well as access the planner through out the day to remind themselves what needs to get done.

## User Story

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
